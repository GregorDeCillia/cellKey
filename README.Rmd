an **R** package for applying noise to statistical tables. 

### Information
This package is developed within the SGA `Open source tools for perturbative confidentiality methods`. This package is not optimized but already contains the core functionality to compute perturbed count- and magnitude tables with complex hierarchies.

We have a first rough version with which interested users may play around. Feedback (via issues) with regards to bugs or features requests are very welcome as well as pull-requests. One the package is deemed stable, a version will be released on CRAN too.

### Important Note:
As of versions `>= 0.17`, you need to use functionality of [`sdcHierarchies`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sdcHierarchies) to setup hierarchies of your tables in `perturbTable()`. The following changes are possibly required in existing code. 

- replace `ck_create_node()` with `hier_create()`
- replace `ck_add_nodes()` with `hier_add()`
- replace `ck_delete_nodes()` with `hier_delete()`
- replace `ck_rename_nodes()` with `hier_rename()`

### Installation
The package can directly be installed from `github` using the `remotes` package which is pulled in as a dependency from the `devtools` package. The following snippet installs the package:

```
# make sure that all packages are up-to-date
update.packages(ask = FALSE)

# make sure that devtools-pkg is available
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# install cellKey from github.com
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "sdcTools/cellKey", 
  force = TRUE, 
  build_opts = "--no-resave-data"
)
```

If you experience a timeout due to a proxy server while downloading, one can work around this issue by specifying the proxy-server using the `httr` package:
```
httr::set_config(use_proxy(url = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, port = yy))
```

### Usage
An example using both possible input formats for perturbation tables is given in the main function of the packge `perturbTable()`

```
?cellKey::perturbTable
```

The package vignette is currently work-in-progress. It can be looked at using `cellKey::ck_vignette()` or via the automatically deployed documentation by clicking [**here**](https://sdctools.github.io/cellKey/articles/introduction.html). The complete [**documentation**](https://sdctools.github.io/cellKey/) is also updated automatically and can be browed online.
